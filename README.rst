 Emacs Configuration
=====================


Try it with Docker!
===================

This is the **easiest way to try** all this set of configurations without
touching your computer configuration and break anything::

     docker run --rm -it -e DISPLAY -v $(pwd):/src -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
       -v $XAUTHORITY:/root/.Xauthority --net=host humitos/emacs-x11-alpine


Full documentation for Docker image: https://github.com/humitos/emacs-x11-alpine

By running this configuration using Docker, you can start an emacs
instance without breaking anything in your existing emacs
configuration or even without having emacs installed in your computer.

The idea of this Docker image, is that you can easily check some of
the shortcuts and modules that I'm using and start using them in your
own configuration by _maybe_ copying that chunk of configuration from
`startup.d/` folder.

Or, you can just use this Docker image as your daily editor :)

If you really like this configuration, you could install it in your
computer with the following instructions.

----

Installation
============

  NOTE: do not installing it if you are not sure what you are doing... :)


#. Clone this repository on the standard `.emacs.d` settings directory::

     cd ~
     git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/humitos/emacs-configuration.git .emacs.d
     cd .emacs.d
     git submodule init

#. Update git submodules and compile necessary modules (helm, ctags and silver searcher, among others)::

   ./bin/update_git_submodules

#. Put in your `~/.emacs`::

     ;; set default user emacs directory
     (setq emacs-user-directory "~/.emacs.d/")

     (load (concat emacs-user-directory "init.el"))

#. Run emacs

----

  NOTE: all of this configuration was tested in
   * Xubuntu 16.04 LTS
   * Emacs 26.0.50
   * git 2.14.1
   * Python 2.7.13
   * Firefox 55.0.2


Install Python necessary modules
================================

I'm installing all the necesary package for `elpy` in each virtualenv
that I'm working on, so you should run this command in your venvs

Install necessary packages::

      pip install -U -r requirements.elpy.in

For virtualenv creation, I'm using `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_.


Install required system packages
================================


::

     sudo apt-get install emacs git aspell-es


ctags compilation::

     sudo apt-get install clang-format


Configure Firefox to export bookmarks automatically
===================================================

  This is needed for `helm-firefox` to find your bookmarks and keep
  them updated.

Open your Firefox and go to `about:config` in firefox url
toolbar. Search for this line::

  user_pref("browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML", false);

Double click on this line to enable its value to true, you should have
now::

  user_pref("browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML", true);


Keep this configuration updated
===============================

::

     cd ~/.emacs.d
     git pull
     ./bin/update_git_submodules
