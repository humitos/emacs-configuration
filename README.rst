=====================
 Emacs Configuration
=====================


I used to have a very customized Emacs configuration with lot of packages,
hotkeys, custom variables and a lot of things.

Then, one day, I met Spacemacs_. Basically, it is *exactly what I had* but
better and **maintained by other people**.

.. _Spacemacs: https://www.spacemacs.org/


*NOTE: there is other branches in this repository with the old configurations,
 in case you care about them or you (**) want to know a specific variable/function
 that I was using*

(**) that's me!
